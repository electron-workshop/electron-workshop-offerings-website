# How to contribute to the Electron Workshop Website

The Electron Workshop website is built with **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**, a fast and flexible static site generator.  
It is deployed on **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**, which handles builds, previews, and hosting.  
For layout and styling we use **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**, providing responsive design, grid layouts, and common UI components.  

Together, this stack keeps the site lightweight, easy to maintain, and friendly for contributors of all levels.


## GitHub & Contributions

The Electron Workshop website is managed through our <https://github.com/electron-workshop/electron-workshop-offerings-website>.  
All changes—whether fixing a typo, updating events, or adding new pages—are made through **pull requests (PRs)**.

A pull request is a way to propose edits: you make changes on your own branch, then open a PR so others can review, test, and merge them into the site. Each PR automatically creates a **Netlify Deploy Preview**, which lets everyone see your edits live before they go public. Clear titles, short commit messages, and screenshots (if relevant) make reviews much easier.
